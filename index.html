        <h2> It's about the Moon!</h2>
        <p>The moon?
He doesn’t shine. He remains.
He stays in the sky like he’s holding back the night itself—
not for glory,
but because someone has to.

He’s not kind. He’s quiet.
The kind of quiet that knows everything and says nothing.
The kind that sees right through you
and still doesn’t look away.

He’s made of sorrow,
but wears it like armor.
Not soft, not glowing—cold silver and sharp craters,
like he’s been through every war
and still refuses to fall.

People call him beautiful.
They’re wrong.
He’s terrible in the way forgotten gods are terrible—
ancient and aching and utterly still.

To me, he’s not a mystery.
He’s a mirror.
When I can't hold myself together, I look at him,
and he’s already in pieces.
But there he is—
whole enough to rise anyway.

And that’s why I watch him.
Not for comfort.
Not for light.
But to remember that broken things can still belong in the sky.

Just like I wish I did.

		<div>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</div>
