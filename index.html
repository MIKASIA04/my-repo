        <h2> It's about the Moon!</h2>
        <p>The moon?
He doesn’t shine. He remains.
He stays in the sky like he’s holding back the night itself—
not for glory,
but because someone has to.

He’s not kind. He’s quiet.
The kind of quiet that knows everything and says nothing.
The kind that sees right through you
and still doesn’t look away.

He’s made of sorrow,
but wears it like armor.
Not soft, not glowing—cold silver and sharp craters,
like he’s been through every war
and still refuses to fall.

People call him beautiful.
They’re wrong.
He’s terrible in the way forgotten gods are terrible—
ancient and aching and utterly still.

To me, he’s not a mystery.
He’s a mirror.
When I can't hold myself together, I look at him,
and he’s already in pieces.
But there he is—
whole enough to rise anyway.

And that’s why I watch him.
Not for comfort.
Not for light.
But to remember that broken things can still belong in the sky.

Just like I wish I did.
